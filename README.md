_As one of the least common types in each assessment, I frequently find myself able to contribute unique perspective as a thought partner and team leader._

## How I Work

I am a post-processor, which means I work best when I take in a lot of information, spend some time mulling it over, and then come back with a plan or position. I am not usually quick-to-conclusion on the spot, and if you provide new information, I'll usually tell you what it makes me think about rather than sharing an opinion right away.

I'm a visual thinker, and I love a good whiteboarding session! Sometimes I'll hop up with a marker just to mindmap live in a meeting. With a diverse and broad base of experiences, I will naturally try to organize strategic information, setting priorities while thinking through complex dependencies. I play out several steps ahead in my mind and _corner-case_ everything.

I am sensitive to the misalignment between people and ideas. I will often comment that something feels _off_ or isn't quite _clicking_ for me. This usually means that I can't quite articulate it yet, but as a post-processor, I will likely come back with a more fully formed thought later. I am driven to call attention and resolve issues like these before they escalate.

I am good at connecting the day-to-day with larger strategic themes. I can operate at both levels, but it takes me a while to switch gears between them. I'd much rather trust my team to deliver on their tactical components while driving alignment to the vision and strategy.

I am a systems thinker. I favor lasting and repeatable ways to coordinate and scale with clarity and efficiency.

I actively research and question, so that I can be precise. I do not readily answer off the top of my head without first understanding the specifics of a situation. Occasionally, I'll act on a _gut feel_ when something feels especially familiar, but I tend to look for specific reason and logic to inform big decisions.

Sometimes, I call my self a "half idea" guy, because even when an idea feels whole, it often happens that someone will contribute more that makes it even better. When I go in thinking I have half the idea, it helps me search for the person with the other half. I am fallible, and I am often flat out wrong. I rarely hold any pride of authorship. I welcome input and different perspectives. Challenge me. I don't take it personally. I want the best outcome, not _my_ outcome.

As an introvert, I can feel drained after a long day, trip, or working session. I will _ghost_ out of parties. I need time to recharge my mental batteries. This also tends to make the mornings a much better time to connect with me about big ideas and open-ended discussions.

## My Management Style

I am not a micro-manager, but I want to know that we are aligned on the funtamentals. I expect that you'll be self-directed for the most part. I believe in communicating objectives and empowering my team to do the jobs they've been hired to do. I will typically share an expected outcome, but rely on you for the specifics of getting there. Along the way, I will attempt to clear obstacles as they come up and make sure we stay aligned.

I'll rarely ask you to do something I wouldn't do myself or that I don't take the time to understand first. If you think I'm asking something unreasonable or that I haven't fully thought through, let's talk. I'll defer to you and other subject matter experts on areas of specialization, but I'll still push back if it feels like we may be missing something. When I don't know something, I'll be open about that and the fact that we may be learning it together.

If we haven't worked together long, I will be more involved in the weeds. I am trying to learn how you work and share the same about me. We'll want to find a rhythm that lets us both contribute our best. Once we've built up a trusting working relationship and a common understanding of each other's expectations, which will take time, you will find that I step back, prefering that you drive your own projects. Don't take this as being left on your own or having a lack of support. We are in this together, so never hesitate to reach out and let me know if there's more that you need.

If I'm feeling out of the loop, I will get more involved. It doesn't necessarily mean that I think there's something wrong, but it likely means that I'm not as informed as I'd like to be.

I believe that I am only successful in my role if you are successful in yours. If I spot your _superpower_, I may push you to use it more, and I will certainly seek to learn from you. If I spot opportunities for development, I'll work with you to make progress, possibly with someone that is much better at a given subject. There's no world in which you falter, and I still feel good about our performance. I'm highly invested in your success and will make myself available when you need me.

## Communication and Meetings

- If you need to reach me quickly, text/SMS is what I will see first. Slack second. Email third. You can message me any time. I turn off notifications in off-hours. If you urgently need me off hours, and I haven't responded to messages, call me on my mobile. My phone will ring for calls 24/7.
- I sometimes work at odd hours, and ideas can strike without a schedule. If I message you off hours, it's usually because I didn't want to lose a thought, but I do not expect a quick response. These days, I've gotten pretty good at using scheduled messages. If something urgent comes up, I'll probably try to reach you by other means when appropriate.
- I keep my calendar up to date. I'll always make time for my direct reports, so if you need me and can't find an opening, ping me, and I'll make it work.
- Please be on-time, prepared, and present for meetings (whether with me or with others). I really try to do the same. Things come up, so if you're going to be late, just give a heads up. If you think I'm not fully present, help me by calling me on it. If there's too much going on to focus in a particular meeting, let's reschedule rather than give it less than full attention.
- Right-size your meetings. Don't schedule 30 minutes for a topic or a large group that will require more time to be productive. Similarly, don't book an hour when 20 minutes will do. Bonus points for wrapping up meetings early. Please avoid running long. The best thing we can do to respect everyone's time when it comes to meetings is to wrap up on time or even early.
- If you don't think you need to be at a meeting, respectfully decline it.

## Some Expectations

- I expect that you will proactively keep me in the know on developments as they come up. Aligned with my own way of working, I have a need to understand topics in detail. A TLDR preamble can be helpful. Please feel free to `cc:` me on anything without feeling that you're giving me an obligation. I appreciate being kept in the know. When in doubt, please include me.
- Part of your role is to do your job, and part of your job is to continually improve the way we perform your function overall. Recognize that what may have been perfect for us six months ago may no longer work. Be the first to raise your hand to call this out rather than the last one hanging on to outdated ways of operating.
- If you take time off, I'll expect that you have your responsibilities and obligations covered ahead of time. Let me know how I can help to cover and be sure your colleagues know who will be accountable for things that may come up.
- Please keep your calendar up to date, blocking times when you will be unavailable or in transit. I make an effort to make sure mine is up-to-date as well.
- Be realistic with your commitments, and then meet them. I try to spot potential risks early and mitigate them. I will be depending on you to meet your obligations for things I may commit to elsewhere. Push back if you feel I am _not_ being realistic, and I will do the same to you.
- I get really frustrated if I end up chasing things for follow-up. If I assign a task or request something, please make sure to close the loop on it appropriately. This, too, goes both ways.
- I appreciate organization, but when things get busy, this is an area that can slip through the cracks. It is important. Please help us collectively get better at staying organized, systematized, and well-documented.
- Ask questions. If a quick volley back and forth can save you a lot of work, no matter how busy things seem, please utilize me. I will do the same.
- I expect that we will agree on some things and also disagree at times. You will have similar experiences with others in our organization. In all cases, I expect that such disagreement and discussion will always be handled with respect and assumption of positive intent. These are opportunities to learn from one another and from the experience.
